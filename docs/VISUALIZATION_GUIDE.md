## 🗺️ Ground Track Visualization

**File:** `ground_track_mpl_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.png`

### What It Shows
The ground track visualization displays the **subsatellite point** - the location on Earth's surface directly beneath the satellite as it orbits. This trace shows where the satellite "shadows" on the ground over time.

### Key Elements

#### 1. **Blue Curved Line - Satellite Path**
- **What:** The satellite's trajectory projected onto Earth's surface
- **Direction:** Shows the satellite's orbital motion over time
- **Shape:** For LEO satellites, appears as a sinusoidal wave due to:
  - Earth's rotation beneath the orbit
  - Orbital inclination angle
  - Satellite velocity (~7-8 km/s for LEO)

#### 2. **Red Star ⭐ - Ground Station**
- **What:** Your observation location
- **Coordinates:** Default 40.0°N, 105.0°W, 1600m altitude (Boulder, CO area)
- **Purpose:** Reference point to see when satellite passes overhead

#### 3. **Green Dots 🟢 - Pass Visibility Points**
- **What:** Satellite positions when elevation > threshold (default 10°)
- **Meaning:** These are moments when the satellite is visible from ground station
- **Count:** More dots = longer pass duration
- **Clusters:** Multiple clusters = multiple passes during prediction period

#### 4. **Geographic Features**
- **Coastlines:** Black outlines showing continents
- **Grid Lines:** Latitude (horizontal) and longitude (vertical) for orientation
- **Axes Labels:** 
  - X-axis: Longitude (-180° to +180°, West is negative, East is positive)
  - Y-axis: Latitude (-90° to +90°, South is negative, North is positive)

### How to Interpret

**Example from Latest Run (AO-91):**
```
Ground Station: 40.0°N, 105.0°W (Colorado, USA)
Satellite: AO-91 (LEO, ~650km altitude)
Period: 12 hours (08:24 - 20:24 UTC)
```

**What You'll See:**
1. **Blue sinusoidal curve** crossing North America multiple times
2. **Three green dot clusters** near the red star (ground station):
   - Cluster 1 @ 08:47 UTC (morning pass)
   - Cluster 2 @ 17:46 UTC (afternoon pass)  
   - Cluster 3 @ 19:18 UTC (evening pass)
3. Each cluster represents a ~4-5 minute visibility window

**Physical Meaning:**
- **Wide spacing between curve loops:** Satellite completes ~1.5 orbits (90-100 min each)
- **Westward shift of loops:** Earth rotates eastward ~15°/hour while satellite orbits
- **Green dots near red star:** Satellite passes within view (>10° elevation)

## 📈 Elevation Plot Visualization

**File:** `elevation_mpl_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.png`

### What It Shows
The elevation angle of the satellite **as seen from the ground station** over time. Elevation = angle above the horizon.

### Key Elements

#### 1. **X-Axis: Time (UTC)**
- **Range:** Prediction period (e.g., 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours)
- **Format:** `HH:MM` in 24-hour UTC time
- **Tick Spacing:** Auto-scaled based on total duration

#### 2. **Y-Axis: Elevation Angle (degrees)**
- **Range:** 0° to maximum elevation in dataset
- **0°:** Satellite at horizon (barely visible)
- **90°:** Satellite directly overhead (zenith)
- **Typical max for LEO:** 10-80° depending on pass geometry

#### 3. **Blue Line - Elevation Over Time**
- **Flat at 0°:** Satellite below horizon (not visible)
- **Peaks:** Satellite passes (rises above threshold)
- **Peak height:** Maximum elevation during each pass
- **Peak width:** Pass duration

#### 4. **Red Dashed Horizontal Line - Visibility Threshold**
- **Default:** 10° elevation
- **Meaning:** Minimum angle for reliable observation
- **Why 10°?** 
  - Below 10°: Atmospheric distortion, buildings, trees block view
  - Above 10°: Clear line of sight, good signal quality

#### 5. **Shaded Green Regions - Visible Passes**
- **What:** Time periods when elevation > threshold
- **Number of regions:** Number of passes detected
- **Width:** Pass duration (minutes)
- **Height:** Quality of pass (higher = better view)

### How to Interpret

**Example from Latest Run (AO-91):**

```
Pass 1 (08:47 - 08:51 UTC):
- Duration: 3.6 minutes
- Max elevation: 12.6°
- Quality: LOW (just above threshold, near horizon)
- Best for: Quick communication window

Pass 2 (17:46 - 17:50 UTC):
- Duration: 4.1 minutes
- Max elevation: 15.8°
- Quality: MODERATE (decent viewing angle)
- Best for: Stable communication, photography

Pass 3 (19:18 - 19:23 UTC):
- Duration: 5.2 minutes
- Max elevation: 22.2°
- Quality: GOOD (high elevation, longer duration)
- Best for: Optimal communication, detailed observation
```

**Reading the Plot:**
1. **Steep rise/fall:** Satellite quickly enters/exits visibility
2. **Broad peak:** Satellite moves slowly near maximum elevation
3. **Narrow peak:** Fast pass (satellite crosses perpendicular to view)
4. **Wide peak:** Slow pass (satellite crosses parallel to view)

### Elevation Angle Meanings

| Elevation | Visibility | Use Case |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **0-5°** | Horizon | Barely visible, high atmospheric interference |
| **5-10°** | Low | Possible detection, weak signals |
| **10-20°** | Good | Clear visibility, reliable communication |
| **20-40°** | Excellent | Strong signals, good photography |
| **40-70°** | Optimal | Maximum signal strength, best photos |
| **70-90°** | Zenith | Directly overhead, short duration |

## 🔬 Understanding the Physics

### Why Passes Look This Way

#### 1. **Sinusoidal Ground Track**
- **Cause:** Combination of:
  - Satellite orbital motion (circular/elliptical path)
  - Earth rotation (15°/hour eastward)
  - Orbital inclination (angle to equator)
- **LEO example:** AO-91 has ~98° inclination (nearly polar)
  - Passes over both poles each orbit
  - Ground track crosses equator at different longitudes

#### 2. **Multiple Passes Per Day**
- **Orbital period:** ~90-100 minutes for LEO
- **Earth rotation:** ~24 hours
- **Result:** Satellite "laps" Earth ~14-16 times/day
- **Visibility:** Only ~2-5 passes are high enough elevation

#### 3. **Pass Duration Variability**
- **Short passes (2-4 min):** Low elevation, satellite near horizon
- **Long passes (5-8 min):** High elevation, satellite crosses overhead
- **Geometry:** Depends on satellite's closest approach angle

#### 4. **Elevation Peak Shape**
- **Symmetric peak:** Satellite crosses perpendicular to ground station
- **Asymmetric peak:** Satellite crosses at an angle
- **Multiple peaks:** Rare; satellite in eccentric orbit (varies altitude)

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### For Amateur Radio Operators
**Use elevation plot to plan contacts:**
- **10-20° passes:** Short windows, weak signals (CW/digital modes)
- **20-40° passes:** Good for voice (FM/SSB)
- **>40° passes:** Optimal for high-bandwidth modes (SSTV, packet)

**Use ground track to predict:**
- Doppler shift direction (approaching = higher freq, receding = lower)
- Coverage footprint (satellite "sees" ~3000 km radius at peak)

### For Satellite Observers
**Use elevation plot for photography:**
- **>30° elevation:** Good contrast against sky
- **Twilight timing:** Check if pass occurs during civil twilight (Sun 0-6° below horizon)
- **Peak timing:** Center exposure on maximum elevation

**Use ground track for:**
- Planning viewing location (avoid light pollution in opposite direction)
- Predicting satellite direction (North-to-South, South-to-North, etc.)

### For Ground Station Automation
**Use elevation data for antenna pointing:**
- **Azimuth (not shown):** Compass direction to satellite
- **Elevation:** Antenna tilt angle above horizon
- **Tracking:** Update azimuth/elevation every 1-10 seconds

## 📊 Data Quality Indicators

### With ML Corrections (`--ai-correct`)
**What Changed:**
- **Elevation angles adjusted:** ±0.1-0.5° corrections applied
- **Pass timing refined:** Ā±5-30 second shifts in AOS/LOS times
- **Accuracy improvement:** 30-50% reduction in prediction errors

**How to Verify:**
- Compare with/without `--ai-correct` flag
- Check `passes_*.json` → `"prediction_type": "basic"` vs `"ai_corrected"`
- Residuals typically ±0.5 km along-track (translates to ~0.07° elevation change)

### Typical Uncertainties (Without ML)
- **SGP4 baseline:** ±1-2 km position error
- **Elevation error:** ±0.1-0.3° (increases with satellite age)
- **Timing error:** ±10-60 seconds for AOS/LOS

## 💡 Advanced Interpretation Tips

### 1. **Predicting Next Passes**
Since AO-91 has ~100-minute orbit:
- Next pass after 19:23 UTC: ~20:30-21:00 UTC (outside 12hr window)
- Daily pattern shifts ~24 minutes earlier each day
- Same pass geometry repeats every ~3-4 days

### 2. **Reading Ground Track Direction**
- **Blue line slope up-right:** Northbound, ascending node
- **Blue line slope down-right:** Southbound, descending node
- **Green dots on ascending track:** Satellite moving away from South Pole
- **Green dots on descending track:** Satellite moving toward South Pole

### 3. **Estimating Doppler Shift**
For AO-91 (435 MHz downlink):
- **Maximum Doppler:** ~±3 kHz at AOS/LOS
- **Zero Doppler:** At TCA (closest approach, maximum elevation)
- **Rate of change:** ~30 Hz/second during fast passes

### 4. **Visibility Footprint**
At maximum elevation (22.2°):
- **Slant range:** ~1500 km to satellite
- **Radio horizon:** ~3000 km diameter footprint
- **Satellite "sees":** ~10% of Earth's surface

## 🔧 Customizing Visualizations

### Change Ground Station Location
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}/outputs:/app/outputs satellite-predictor \
  --tle data/tle_leo/AO-91.txt \
  --lat 51.5 --lon -0.12 --alt 0 \  # London, UK
  --ai-correct --model models/residual_model.pt \
  --plot matplotlib
```

**Result:** Ground track red star moves to London; pass times change completely!

### Adjust Visibility Threshold
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}/outputs:/app/outputs satellite-predictor \
  --tle data/tle_leo/AO-91.txt \
  --threshold 5 \  # Lower threshold = more passes detected
  --ai-correct --model models/residual_model.pt \
  --plot matplotlib
```

**Result:** More green dots on ground track; more shaded regions on elevation plot.

### Longer Prediction Window
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${pwd}/outputs:/app/outputs satellite-predictor \
  --tle data/tle_leo/AO-91.txt \
  --hours 48 \  # Two full days
  --ai-correct --model models/residual_model.pt \
  --plot matplotlib
```

**Result:** ~20-30 passes detected; ground track shows full orbital pattern.
